This is a Ruby on Rails web app which lets you keep track of your board games.

You can:

* Create an account in the database

* Create, edit, and remove board games

* Add other users as your friends in order to see their board games

* Search for board games you or your friends own

* Upload images of your board games (with proper setup)

You can run the app by simply bundling the gems and then running '$ rails s' in terminal.
